Matchday 12 in the Bundesliga ended with an entertaining 4-2 win over Hertha Berlin in the German capital. Goals from Lars Stindl and Thorgan Hazard, not to mention a Raffael brace, secured three points that ensure the Foals will spend the night in third place.

Borussia couldn’t have wished for a better start at the Olympiastadion, with Lars Stindl turning the ball home inside five minutes after a penetrating run forward and cut-back from Denis Zakaria. Ten minutes later, they were awarded a penalty kick by the video assistant referee, after Karim Rekik had blocked Stindl’s effort with an outstretched arm inside the box. Thorgan Hazard took on the responsibility from twelve yards and coolly despatched his spot-kick. Things went from amazing to incredible when Raffael killed a high ball with his first touch and then thundered an unstoppable shot into the top corner of the Hertha goal past a helpless Rune Jarstein. However, with a 3-0 lead after just 20 minutes, complacency perhaps set in and Hertha found another gear at the same time. Vedad Ibisevic bundled home a lifeline for the hosts, before a string of Berlin corners required a fine Yann Sommer save and some help from the woodwork to ensure the Fohlenelf still held a 3-1 advantage at the break.

The second half was a much more organised affair as both sides tried to establish dominance, which led to a gripping midfield battle, albeit without many chances. The first real opportunity that came told too, when a set piece was nodded down to Mitchell Weiser who fired in off the far post. Nerves began to creep in for the travelling supporters, but Raffael soon rid them with his second goal of the day, slotting home after he had been picked out by substitute Patrick Herrmann. The fourth goal ended Hertha’s challenge and Gladbach could celebrate a third consecutive away win in the Bundesliga, which temporarily moves the Foals up into third place.
