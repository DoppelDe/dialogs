Claudio Marchisio's second-half double earned Juventus a 3-2 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in Miami on Wednesday.

The Italy international scored the goal of the game, a fiercely-struck effort in the 62nd minute, and the winner from the penalty spot in the final minute.

Gonzalo Higuain gave Juve the lead on the stroke of half-time before Goncalo Guedes equalised within eight minutes of the restart.

Javier Pastore hauled PSG level for the second time with 10 minutes to go but Marchisio's late strike ensured Unai Emery's men ended their pre-season tour of the United States with back-to-back defeats, following their 4-2 loss to Tottenham.

After a subdued opening, Angel Di Maria's fine 25th-minute effort called Gianluigi Buffon into an excellent save.

Paulo Dybala then went close on 28 minutes but his free-kick was tipped over by Alphonse Areola.

The Argentine was involved in the opening goal, though, setting up compatriot Higuain who advanced on goal before calmly beating Areola.

It was a brilliant finish matched only by Marchisio's 62nd-minute strike, which restored Juve's lead after Guedes had tapped home a Di Maria cross to level the scores on 53 minutes.

Buffon's replacement Carlo Pinsoglio enjoyed an impressive second-half run out but he could do little with Javier Pastore's close range header on 80 minutes.

But Marchisio would have the final say a minute after Presnel Kimpembe sent Moise Kean tumbling in the area and the midfielder converted from 12 yards.

Juventus finish off their US tour against Serie A rivals Roma in Boston on Sunday, while PSG head to Morocco for a pre-season clash with Ligue 1 champions Monaco.
