Neymar scored two wonder goals as Barcelona beat Juventus 2-1 in the International Champions Cup at the MetLife Stadium on Saturday.

The Brazil international is wanted by Paris Saint Germain, and once again the player showed exactly why in New Jersey.

A Sky source in Spain, close to Neymar, has told us that there's a "90 per cent chance" he will leave Barca this summer, with PSG prepared to pay a release clause worth nearly Â£200m.

In his 45-minute performance, the playmaker broke the deadlock after receiving the ball from Lionel Messi, before playing a one-two with Paco Alcacer and finishing emphatically.

The TV replays showed Neymar's immaculate close control, despite him running at speed.

Neymar's opening strike may have involved his team-mates, but his second was all about him as he glided past five Juve defenders, before leaving veteran Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon helpless.

Neymar was denied a hat-trick by Buffon, before being substituted at half-time.

The Serie A champions did, however, reduce the deficit in the second half through Giorgio Chiellini's far-post header.
